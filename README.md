# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Brief Description of Project
This is a Ruby command line implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. 
It is meant to be played by two players using the same computer.

You can play the game by visiting the following replit: https://replit.com/@turbulentPanda/TicTacToe

## Goals of Project
The goal of this project was to practice using object oriented programming principles with Ruby.

## What I Learned
This project provided good practice with OOP. It was also a larger project than others that I have completed in Ruby, so it was a good opportunity to synthesize everything I have learned about the language so far. It was also good practice planning out a larger project (at least, larger than what I am used to at this point).

## Next Steps
I had some trouble with getting the Player Class to interact with the Game Class. As such, the main play_game method in the Game Class is bloated and violates the DRY principle. I will return to this project and extract some of that logic into separate methods to make the play_game method less bloated.
